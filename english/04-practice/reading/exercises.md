## 📚 READING 2: Daily Standup (Intermediate)

### Passage
Every morning at 9:30, our team has a daily standup meeting. This meeting usually lasts about 15 minutes. Each team member answers three questions: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Are you blocked by anything?

Yesterday, I worked on the user authentication module. I implemented the login API and wrote unit tests for it. Today, I'm going to add the logout functionality and review my colleague's pull request. I'm not blocked by anything.

The daily standup helps us stay synchronized and identify problems early. If someone is blocked, another team member can offer help immediately.
